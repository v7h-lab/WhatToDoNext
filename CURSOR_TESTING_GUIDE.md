# 🚀 Cursor Testing Guide - What To Do Next

## ✅ **Setup Complete: Build & Test Entirely in Cursor**

**Applied Rules**: Debug logs, comments, 95% confidence, Jetpack Compose, ViewModel with StateFlow, Hilt DI, no multi-module

Your project is now configured to build and test entirely within Cursor using your connected Android device. **No Android Studio required!**

## 📱 **Device Status**

```bash
./build-and-deploy.sh
```
**What it does:**
- Checks device connection
- Builds the APK
- Installs to your device
- Launches the app
- Shows success message

### **2. Quick Test (Development)**
```bash
./quick-test.sh
```
**What it does:**

adb devices
```

### **Build Fails**
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

# Force stop and restart
adb shell am force-stop com.v7h.whattodonext
adb shell am start -n com.v7h.whattodonext/.MainActivity
```

## 🎨 **Live Testing Features**

### **Hot Reload (Manual)**
1. Make code changes
2. Run `./quick-test.sh`
3. App updates on device instantly

### **Theme Testing**
- **Light Theme**: Default system theme
